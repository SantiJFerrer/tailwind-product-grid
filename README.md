# Best Sellers Product Display

This project is a responsive product display page designed to showcase best-selling products using **HTML**, **CSS (TailwindCSS)**, and **JavaScript**. The page dynamically generates product cards with hover effects, adaptive layouts for different screen sizes, and an interactive "Show More" feature for mobile devices.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** 
  - Utilizes TailwindCSS for a mobile-first, fully responsive layout.
  - Two separate product grids: a horizontal scrollable grid for desktops and a grid layout for mobile devices.

- **Product Hover Effects:** 
  - Each product card has a hover effect, smoothly transitioning between the primary and hover images.

- **Show More Button:** 
  - On smaller screens, initially displays a limited number of products with an option to reveal more.

- **Smooth Scroll Customization:** 
  - Custom scrollbar styling for desktop devices to enhance the user experience.

- **Dynamic Product Rendering:** 
  - JavaScript is used to dynamically populate product details and optimize rendering based on screen size.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Structure and semantics.
- **TailwindCSS:** Utility-first framework for styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Handles dynamic product rendering and interactivity.
